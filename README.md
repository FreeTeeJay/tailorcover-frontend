# TailorCover — Frontend (GitHub Pages)

Single-file UI to talk to the TailorCover API.

## Use on GitHub Pages
- Put `index.html` at the repo root.
- Repo → Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch → `main` / root.
- Open your Pages URL and set the **Backend URL** to your deployed API.

## Local
Just open `index.html` in a browser and point Backend URL to `http://localhost:8000` if running the API locally.
